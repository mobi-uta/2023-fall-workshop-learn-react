		<p>A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance. A component can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page.</p>
		<p>You're separating that component's logic away from the rest of your application. Let's say you have a playing card, but you copy and pasted the card styles everywhere in your application.</p>
		<p>If you want to make a change to it, it'll be extremely tedious. Instead, you can make a <LearnTerm term="component" def="some text" /> and only change once to change everywhere! Think of it like a template.</p>
